OpenSC GUI
============

A simple GUI created for [OpenSC](https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki) to have an easy way to manage the card pin of smart cards. The project was initiated by [TIS-innovation-park](https://tis.bz.it/en) for the [testingmachine.eu project](https://testingmachine.eu/). OpenSC-GUI was developed in C++ with the [QT-Framework](http://qt-project.org) in collaboration with KMS-Mechatronics.

The big advantages of the OpenSC-GUI are:
* cross-platform
* open-source
* works for a big variety of smart-cards
